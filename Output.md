| **Campaign ID** | **Revenue**  | **Impressions** | **Clicks** | **Channel**         | **Run Date**   |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| CAMP_A          | $150,000      | 100,000         | 2,500      | WhatsApp            | 2025-07-05     |
| CAMP_B          | **$200,000** | 80,000          | 4,000      | Email               | 2025-07-10     |
| CAMP_C          | $175,000      | **120,000**     | 3,600      | SMS                 | 2025-07-15     |

3. **Investigate WhatsApp (CAMP_A)**: Test ways to boost engagement (e.g., interactive messages).
4. **Review Push Notifications (CAMP_D)**: Low performance may indicate poor targeting or messaging—consider A/B testing or pausing underperforming segments.
